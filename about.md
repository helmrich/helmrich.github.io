## Hey there,

I'm Tobias Helmrich, an iOS Developer from Germany. I love learning and building things. 

At the moment I'm trying to absorb everything about iOS Development and the Swift programming language. I'm also fond of beautiful designs and I try to become better at designing as well.

Besides designing and developing I enjoy reading, learning languages, listening to music, watching anime and drinking good coffee.

If you want to get in touch with me you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tobias_helmrich) or send me an email to <me@tobias-helmrich.de>. I'm looking forward to hear from you!
