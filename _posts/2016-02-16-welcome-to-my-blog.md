Hey there and welcome to my blog! In this post I just want to talk about why I'm writing in this blog. The number one reason for this blog is to write down my experiences with code and everything that has to do with it. That means that all the posts I'm writing here are reflecting my *opinion* and experiences, so this blog is not primarily thought as a source of information for others but more as a future reference for myself and a possibility to reflect over what I've learned and what mistakes I made.

Of course I'm happy when I can help someone with what I'm writing here as they're might encountering the same problem I did and everyone can feel free to use the code I'm posting here in their own projects but I *do not guarantee* that everything I post and write here is correct. I'm sure it isn't. So if there are any issues please don't make me responsible for that. I also don't want to offend anyone's opinion, let's just code peacefully! :)
